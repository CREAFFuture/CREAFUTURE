## Causality

- Simpson's paradox: a trend revealed by a dataset can reverse when the dataset is split into groups. It is related to the [ecological fallacy](http://lineardigressions.com/episodes/2016/5/28/ecological-inference-and-simpsons-paradox): a mistaken deductive reasoning, in which we try to draw conclusions about individuals based on data collected at the group level. Some claim that the paradox [does not exist](https://wildetruth.substack.com/p/simpsons-paradox-and-existential).

## Community ecology

- David Zelen√Ω's [webpage](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:start) contains theory, and R functions and examples on ordination analysis, numerical classification, community-weighted-mean, fourth corner methods & RLQ, and diversity analysis.
