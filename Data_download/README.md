# Resources to get data sets


## Generalist datasets

- R comes with some standard data sets, check "data()" or the datasets package. It is common for R packages to contain data sets that demonstrate functions.


## Repositories of ecological datasets

- [Knowledge Network for Biodiversity (KNB)](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/data) is an international repository of ecological data sets. At the time of writing (24th March 2023) it stores [over 28,000 datasets.](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/profile), with [uneven geographical coverage](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/data). Find a light introduction to its use [here.](https://www.rforecology.com/post/top-five-ish-sources-of-ecological-data/)
- [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp) archives a lot of environmental data that comes from publicly-funded research, in particular, Long-Term Ecological research (LTER) in the USA. Find a light introduction to its use [here.](https://www.rforecology.com/post/top-five-ish-sources-of-ecological-data/)
- [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore) is a network of field sites across the USA that regularly collect ecological data. Find a light introduction to its use [here.](https://www.rforecology.com/post/top-five-ish-sources-of-ecological-data/)


## Repositories for spcies occurrence

- [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/)
- [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org/): like GBIF for marine species. Find a light introduction to its use [here.](https://www.rforecology.com/post/top-five-ish-sources-of-ecological-data/)


## Repositories of repositories

Indeed, some webpages aggregate or provide convenient lists of pre-existing repositories, 

- [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) aggregates data sets from several repositories and organizations (including the already mentioned KNB, EDI and NEON). At the time of writing (24th March 2023) it stores [over 840,000 datasets, with uneven geographical coverage.]((https://search.dataone.org/data))
- [Central Michigan University Library](https://www.cmich.edu/research/cmu-library) hosts a great list of resources, including [ecological](https://libguides.cmich.edu/lifesciencedata/ecological), [organismal](https://libguides.cmich.edu/lifesciencedata/organismal) and [environmental](https://libguides.cmich.edu/lifesciencedata/environmental) data.
