# Data visualization
---

- [The R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) is an excellent resource on many different types of visualizations. Ideal to get a quick inspiration of what graph is best suited to tell you story!
- [R Graphics cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) offers more than 150 recipes to create many types of graphs.
- The [Fronkonstin](https://fronkonstin.com/) blog contains many playful visualizations, and experiments on what can be achieved graphically in R. Maybe not a learning resource per se, but very aesthetically pleasant.
- Boxplots can be [improved](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/#charts) by showing the distribution of data, for instance by plotting jittered and transparent points, or by combining them with violin plots.
- Data visualization can also be done in Python, for instance with the[seaborn library](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), examples [here.](https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/04/19/awesome_seaborn_visuals/)
