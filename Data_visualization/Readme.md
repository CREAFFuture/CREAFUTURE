- [The R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) is an excellent resource on many different types of visualizations. Ideal to get a quick inspiration of what graph is best suited to tell you story!
- [R Graphics cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) offers more than 150 recipes to create many types of graphs.
- The [Fronkonstin](https://fronkonstin.com/) blog contains many playful visualizations, and experiments on what can be achieved graphically in R. Maybe not a learning resource per se, but very aesthetically pleasant.
